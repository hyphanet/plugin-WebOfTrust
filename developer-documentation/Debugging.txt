There are certain functions which check for errors in the database which cannot be used during normal operation of WOT.
This is because they are very expensive or destroy the database.

They can only be manually executed by developers. And as a developer you SHOULD do that periodically.

Those are:
- DEBUG logging: You should set a loglevel of "plugins.WebOfTrust:DEBUG" in your Freenet node and let WOT run for a long time with that.
  There are some checks, for example the startup database integrity test, which only get executed if debug logging is enabled.
  Additionally, you can set the base log level ("Minimum priority to log messages at") of your node to NONE to ensure that nothing
  but WOT messages gets logged.

- If you don't want DEBUG logging for the whole of WOT but only for certain classes, make sure to enable WARNING/ERROR logging for everything
  at least: Set "Detailed priority thresholds" to begin with "plugins.WebOfTrust:WARNING" (this includes ERROR as it is above WARNING.
  Add the classes for which you want to enable debug logging separated by "," after that.
  
- The class "DebugFCPClient": It is a FCP client which runs inside WOT itself. You can enable it by setting its loglevel to DEBUG,
  either explicitly via "plugins.WebOfTrust.ui.fcp.DebugFCPClient:DEBUG" by or by setting the global loglevel of WOT to DEBUG.
  It will connect to WOT's own FCP interface and subscribe to all types of event-notifications. It will store all identities,
  trusts and scores it has received via event-notifications in memory. At shutdown, it will validate whether the in-memory contents
  match what is stored in the WOT database. This allows you to test whether subscriptions work as desired.
  It might also be useful to set the loglevels of the backend classes to DEBUG as well. Also, make sure to keep WARNING/ERROR logging for
  everything else enabled as suggested in the previous note - there are member classes of SubscriptionManager which you want to be able
  to log WARNING/ERROR.
  In total, you will end up with these at "Detailed priority thresholds":
  plugins.WebOfTrust:WARNING,plugins.WebOfTrust.ui.fcp.DebugFCPClient:DEBUG,plugins.WebOfTrust.ui.fcp.FCPClientReferenceImplementation:DEBUG,plugins.WebOfTrust.SubscriptionManager:DEBUG
  
- WebOfTrust.checkForDatabaseLeaks(). It will delete all identities in the database which should also delete ALL other objects.
  Then it will check whether objects of any class still exist in the database. If they do, they are leaks.
  Ideally, you would use this on a WOT database upon which WOT has been running for quite a few days. 
  Usually you should use this function whenever you modify what is stored in the database to make sure you don't leak stuff..
  
- Assertions. Use the "-ea" switch of Java to enable them. Ideally, you would sometimes do a test run which consists of:
	* Starting WOT with a fresh database and assertions enabled
	* Creating at least one own identity
	* Letting WOT run over night or longer until it has fetched all on-network identities.
	  This will generate lots of traffic on all functions of WOT and might trigger AssertionFailedError exception which
	  should show up in the log files. You can also set a breakpoint on those exceptions in Eclipse.
  Usually you should do an assertion test run whenever you modify the score computation algorithms since they are heavily
  guarded by assertions.

Useful breakpoints during debug test runs:
- AssertionError: Will hit on failure of Java assert() statements. There are many useful of those in the WOT code.
- AssertionFailedError: Will hit on failure of JUnit tests.
- NullPointerException: Dereferencing of a pointer which is null shouldn't happen in normal code.
- UnsupportedOperationException: This exception is typically thrown in WOT-functions which are NOT implemented. Therefore, those functions
  should not be used. If this is thrown it indicates that they ARE being used even though they shouldn't.

Other stuff useful for developers:
- The constant "WebOfTrust.FAST_DEBUG_MODE" which reduces the execution delays of the IntroductionServer / IntroductionClient.
