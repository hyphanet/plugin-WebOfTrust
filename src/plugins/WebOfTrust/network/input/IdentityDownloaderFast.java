 * Further, for the purpose of {@link WebOfTrust#restoreOwnIdentity(freenet.keys.FreenetURI)},
 * all {@link OwnIdentity}s are also considered as directly trusted (as long as
 * {@link WebOfTrust#shouldFetchIdentity(Identity)} returns true for them, which it currently
 * always does but may not do for some if we implement code to detect when restoring is finished).
 * See {@link #shouldDownload(Identity)}.
 * 
 * This notably is only a small subset of the total set of {@link Identity}s.
 * That's necessary because USK subscriptions are expensive, they create a constant load of
 * polling on the network.
 * The lack of this class subscribing to all {@link Identity}s is compensated by
 * {@link IdentityDownloaderSlow} which deals with the rest of them in a less expensive manner:  
 * It downloads editions only when there is an {@link EditionHint} indicating that the editions do
 * very likely exist.  
 * EditionHints are obtained from remote Identitys (and thus could be fake).
 * 
 * (Therefore IdentityDownloaderFast does *not* use {@link USKManager#hintUpdate(USK, long,
 * ClientContext)} like its predecessor {@link IdentityFetcher} did.  
 * TODO: Performance: Consider whether it might make sense to use that function in some special
 * cases, e.g. along with restoreOwnIdentity() where we have some confidence that the hint which
