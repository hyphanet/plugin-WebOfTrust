/**
 * This is a reference implementation of how a FCP client application should interact with
 * Web Of Trust via event-notifications.<br>
 * The foundation of event-notifications is class {@link SubscriptionManager}, you should read the
 * JavaDoc of it to understand them.<br><br>
 * 
 * You can use this class in your client like this:<br>
 * - Copy-paste this class. Make sure to specify the hash of the commit which your copy is based on!
 *   <br>
 * - Do NOT modify it. Instead, implement a separate class which implements the required interfaces
 *   {@link ConnectionStatusChangedHandler}, {@link BeginSubscriptionSynchronizationHandler} and
 *   {@link EndSubscriptionSynchronizationHandler}, {@link SubscribedObjectChangedHandler}.
 *   In your separate class, create an object of this class here, and use its public functions to
 *   pass your handler implementations to it.<br>
 * - If you do need to modify this class for improvements, please ensure that they are backported
 *   to WOT.<br>
 * - It should periodically be checked if all client applications use the most up to date version
 *   of this class.<br>
 * - To simplify checking whether a client copy of this class is outdated, the hash of the commit
 *   which the copy was based on helps very much. Thats why we want to stress that you should
 *   include the hash in your copypasta!<br><br>
 * 
 * For understanding how to implement a user of this class, please just read the JavaDoc of the
 * public functions and interfaces. I tried to sort all function by order of execution and provide
 * full JavaDoc, so I hope the whole private internals of this class will be easy to understand as
 * well.<br><br>
 * 
 * NOTICE: This class was based upon class SubscriptionManagerFCPTest, which you can find in the unit tests. Please backport improvements.
 * [Its not possible to link it in the JavaDoc because the unit tests are not within the classpath.] 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * TODO: JavaDoc: The part of this class about subscription synchronization could need more JavaDoc.
 *  
 * @see FCPInterface The "server" to which a FCP client connects.
 * @see SubscriptionManager The foundation of event-notifications and therefore the backend of all FCP traffic which this class does.
