/**
 * A {@link DelayedBackgroundJob} implementation that uses a {@link Ticker} for scheduling.<br><br>
 * 
 * This can be considered the "standard" implementation of {@link DelayedBackgroundJob}: Compared to
 * {@link SynchronousDelayedBackgroundJob} and {@link MockDelayedBackgroundJob}, which are intended
 * to be used in tests, it is more thoroughly tested by unit tests.<br><br>
 * 
 * ATTENTION: The unit tests for this class will not by run by the build script by default! They
 * are only run if Ant is executed with parameter "-Dtest.unreliable=true".<br>
 * This is because the tests are timing sensitive, and thus may fail randomly on slow machines.
 * See <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=6521">the relevant bugtracker entry</a>.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * FIXME: PrioritizedTicker.realRun() almost re-runs this class' jobs if they throw during
 * execution, it only doesn't do so because we implement FastRunnable.
 * Since PrioritizedTicker is fred code, it can change in the future without our knowledge, it
 * might be changed to **do** re-run the jobs even when using FastRunnable.  
 * But BackgroundJobs must not be re-run, a single call to their triggerExecution() must only yield
 * a single execution.  
 * Potential fixes:
 * - Documentation which ensures we keep using FastRunnable.
 * - Or just use our own scheduler class instead of Ticker (fred might not want us to do that, e.g.
 *   to ensure its Executor is used? I don't recall this precisely.)
 * - Add try/catch blocks to ensure they cannot throw.
 * - Add two variables, "long nextRunID = 0; long lastRunID = 0". triggerExecution() increments
 *   "nextRunID". Once the execution starts check if "lastRunID == nextRunID". If yes the
 *   execution had already happened, do not run it again. If no, set "lastRunID = nextRunID" and
 *   run it.
 * FIXME: Also, because we use FastRunnable we block the ticker thread while we try to acquire
 * our lock. So make damn sure that we don't take the lock for a long time anywhere in this class.  
 * Or maybe don't use FastRunnable if possible?
